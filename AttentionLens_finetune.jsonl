Caffeine acts as a central nervous system stimulant by blocking adenosine receptors, leading to increased dopamine and norepinephrine release in the brain. This can enhance focus and alertness. However, its effect on hyperactivity and impulsivity remains unclear, as some studies indicate that caffeine may worsen symptoms in certain individuals, especially in high doses. Additionally, caffeine is not an approved substitute for traditional ADHD treatments, such as stimulant medications or behavioral therapy."}]}
